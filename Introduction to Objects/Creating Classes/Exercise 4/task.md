## Mastering the IDE: Quick Documentation in the Completion List

The <span class="control">`Quick Documentation`</span> shortcut 
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:QuickJavaDoc;</span> 
can be used not only in the editor but in the code completion popup list as well.

Using this feature, find the function for `String` that upper-cases only its
first letter, or returns the original string if it's already starts with an
upper case letter.
