## Mastering the IDE: Comment / Uncomment

You can comment and uncomment a line of code by using one shortcut:
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CommentByLineComment;</span>. 
Calling this action on an uncommented line will comment
it, calling it on a commented line will uncomment it.

Using this shortcut is much faster than commenting or uncommenting lines by
hand.

Uncomment the first `println()` command, and comment the second one using the
shortcut.
