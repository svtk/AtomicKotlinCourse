<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Extend Selection</h2><p>When you apply refactorings like <span class="control"><code>Extract Property</code></span>, 
you need to select the expression that you'd like to extract, which might be 
quite complicated.</p><p>The <span class="control"><code>Extend Selection</code></span> action accessible with the
<span class="shortcut">&amp;shortcut:EditorSelectWord;</span> shortcut is very
helpful here: it selects the outside expression, increasing the selection by
each step. The reverse action is called
<span class="control"><code>Shrink selection</code></span> and is accessible by
<span class="shortcut">&amp;shortcut:EditorUnSelectWord;</span>.</p><p>Try putting the caret on line <code>println("Incorrect input: $x should be
positive")</code> and extend and shrink the selection to see how it works.
Continue to extend the selection until the whole file is selected.</p>
