<h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary 2 (#1)</h2><p>Convert from a number in the Roman numeral system into a natural number.</p><p>For instance: XXIII = 23, XLIV = 44, C = 100.</p>
<div class='hint'>You can simply iterate over each numeral in the Roman representation and
calculate the answer! Traverse a Roman number in reverse order a single numeral
at a time (for example, `IV` are two different numerals) and store the maximum
numeral found so far. If the next Roman numeral is more or equal than the current
maximum numeral, add it to the result; if it's less than a maximum, subtract it
instead. For instance, to convert `XLIV = 44`, iterate over `VILX` which is the
reverse of `XLIV`. You add `V`(`5`) and `L`(`50`), but subtract `1`(`I`) because
it's less than the current maximum `V`, and subtract `10`(`X`) because it's less
than the updated maximum `X`:

| numeral | current maximum | action |
| ------- |-----------------|--------|
| V       | 5               | + 5    |
| I       | 5               | - 1    |
| L       | 50              | + 50   |
| X       | 50              | - 10   |

The result is `+ 5 - 1 + 50 - 10 = 44`</div>
