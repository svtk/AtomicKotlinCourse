## Lists (#1)

The Kotlin standard library contains many functions that work with `Lists`.
It's a good exercise to implement some of them by hand.

Write a function `findMax()` that finds the maximum value in a `List` of
natural numbers. If the `List` is empty, return zero. `findMax()` takes
`IntList` as an argument---this is a toy class that only allows you to
iterate over a `List`'s contents, get its size and access elements by index.
