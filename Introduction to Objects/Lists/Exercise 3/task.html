<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lists (#1)</h2><p>Write a function that decides whether two strings are anagrams or not. An
anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using
all the original letters exactly once.</p>
<div class='hint'>Compare two sorted lists of characters obtained from two strings.
If the lists are equal, the words are anagrams.
For example, for two anagrams "terrain" and "trainer"
the sorted character list will be `[a, e, i, n, r, r, t]`.
Convert a string to a list by calling `toList()`.</div>
