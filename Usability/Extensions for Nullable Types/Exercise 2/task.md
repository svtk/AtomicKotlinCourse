## Extensions for Nullable Types (#2)

Implement `and` and `or` functions on nullable Boolean which take another 
nullable Boolean as an argument and return `null` if either the receiver or 
the argument is null. For non-null values these functions should behave 
similarly to regular `and` and `or` operations.
