## Extensions for Nullable Types (#2)

Implement `and()` and `or()` functions that extend nullable `Boolean`. These
functions each take a second nullable `Boolean` as a parameter and return
`null` if either the receiver or the argument is `null`. For non-`null` values
these functions behave the same as ordinary `and` and `or` operations.
