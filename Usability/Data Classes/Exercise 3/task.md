## Data Classes (#3)

The starter code contains definitions for the `data` classes `Author` and
`Book`. Create a function called `authorBooksMap()` that takes a `List` of
books as its parameter. It builds and returns a `Map` with `Author` as the key
which maps to to the books written by that author.
