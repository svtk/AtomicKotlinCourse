## Inheritance (#1)

The starter code contains an `open` class `Cleanser` and a class `Detergent`
that inherits it. Add to the `Cleanser` class the property
`var ops: MutableList<String>` and the functions `dilute()`, `apply()` and
`scrub()` which simply add their names to `ops`. In `main`, make sure that
`Detergent` has now the same functions as `Cleanser`.
