## Polymorphism (#2)

The starter code contains class `Frog`, which extends `Animal`. `Animal`
defines two member functions `talk()` and `jump()` which are overridden by
`Frog`. All functions display their information using `println()`. Note that an
`Animal` always talks right after it jumps.

`main()` creates a `Frog`, stores it as `Animal`, then calls `jump()`. Your
task is to guess what the output will be.
