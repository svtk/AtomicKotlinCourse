## Polymorphism (#1)

The starter code contains the code from `FantasyGame.kt`. Add an interface
`Flyer` with a `fly()` method. Add two new characters:

- A `Dragon` that can fly, by implementing `Flyer`.
- A `Wizard` that can perform magic and fly, by implementing `Magician` and `Flyer`.

Uncomment the  call to `playTurn()` in `main()` and ensure it compiles.
