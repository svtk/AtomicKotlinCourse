## Mastering the IDE: Project Tool Window

The icons at the top of the <span class="control">`Project`</span> Tool Window
allow to perform several convenient operations.
For example, you can locate the currently opened file in the
<span class="control">`Project`</span> Tool Window by clicking on the
<span class="control">`Scroll from Source`</span> icon.

Alternatively, press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:SelectIn;</span> or choose
<span class="control">`Navigate | Select in...`</span> from the menu above.
Then choose <span class="control">`Project View`</span> in the open menu.

Press the <span class="control">`Collapse All`</span> button on the
<span class="control">`Project`</span> Tool Window to hide all the
project content, then open the current file by trying all the options listed
above.
