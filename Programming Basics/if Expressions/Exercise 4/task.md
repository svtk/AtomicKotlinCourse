## Mastering the IDE: Navigating to a Function

You can easily see how a function is defined. To navigate to a function
definition, put the caret on the usage and press
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoDeclaration;</span>. 
Alternatively, you may choose <span class="control">`Navigate`</span> 
in the application menu, and then <span class="control">`Declaration`</span>.

Put the caret on the `oneOrTheOther()` function usage in `main()` and navigate
to the function definition. Your caret should move to the `oneOrTheOther()`
function definition.
