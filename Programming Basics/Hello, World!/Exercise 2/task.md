## Hello, World! (#2)

Display "Hello, Kotlin!" on the console, but with "Kotlin" appearing on the
next line. You can display two separate strings to achieve this:

```
Hello,
Kotlin!
```

Try replacing `println()` with `print()` and see what changes.

Subsequent exercises in this book assume `println()` rather than `print()` for
displaying data on the console.
