## Mastering the IDE: Find Action

Memorizing the shortcuts for the different actions takes time.
After a while, you'll learn automatically the ones that you use often, 
but remembering all of them is almost impossible.

To solve this, IntelliJ IDEA provides a universal way to call an action by its
name. Simply press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoAction;</span>. 
Alternatively, you may choose <span class="control">`Help | Find Action`</span>
on the main menu.

<span class="control">`Find action`</span>
allows you to enter the name you're looking for. You may type
only a part of the name, and IntelliJ shows all the names that fit.

Try typing the names of actions that we've seen so far:
* <span class="control">`Specify type explicitly`</span>;
* <span class="control">`Rename`</span>;
* <span class="control">`Convert to expression/block body`</span>;
* <span class="control">`Navigate to declaration`</span>. 

You can display the intention actions by calling the action 
<span class="control">`Show intention actions`</span>,
but it's such a common operation that it's better to memorize a
shortcut for it.

Rename `val x` and specify its type explicitly by calling
corresponding actions using <span class="control">`Find action`</span>.
