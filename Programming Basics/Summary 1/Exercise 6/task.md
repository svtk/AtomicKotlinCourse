## Summary 1 (#6)

In this exercise, we'll modify `Overflow.kt` so it tests `Long` and `Double`
in the same way. The `testLong()` function should print the `Long` maximum value
increased by `1`. The `testDouble()` function should print the `Double` maximum value
increased by `1`. `testDouble2()` should print the result of comparison
of `Double.MAX_VALUE` and `Double.MAX_VALUE + 1`.
