## Operations on Collections (#4)

Functions `all()`, `none()` and `any()` are interchangeable, you can use one
or the other to implement the same functionality.  
Implement the functions `allNonZero()` and `hasZero()` using all three 
predicates in turn. `allNonZero()` checks that all the elements in the list 
are non-zero; `hasZero()` checks that the list contains `zero` element.
The implementations using `all()` are given.
