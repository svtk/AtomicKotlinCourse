## Sequences (#4)

Implement the `findFavouriteInstructorForStudent()` function.
It takes `Student` as a parameter and finds an instructor which classes this 
student takes more often. 
If there're several such instructors, the first one is returned,
if a student took no classes at all yet, `null` is returned.
