## Sequences (#3)

Implement the `getAverageRatingForInstructor()` function which takes 
`Instructor` as a parameter and calculates the average rating that the 
instructor was given by all the students that attended his or her classes.
If a student attended several lessons of the instructor, the ratings for
individual lessons should be treated separately.
